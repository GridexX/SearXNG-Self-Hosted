## Description

SearXNG

This repository aims to create a new SearXNG instance in five minutes using Docker containers.
It provides a combination with Nginx Proxy Manager to creates a SSL endpoint to your instance.

## How to Deploy this repo ?

### Prerequisites

- `Docker` ~ 20
- `Git`

### Commands

```bash
  # Clone the repo
  git clone git@github.com:GridexX/SearXNG-Self-Hosted.git

  # Move in the main directory
  cd SearXNG-Self-Hosted

  # Replace the Secret Key used by SearchXNG
  sed -i "s|ultrasecretkey|$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" searxng/settings.yml

  # Start the containers
  docker compose up -d
```

## Reverse Proxy with Nginx Proxy Manager

To add a custom Domain Name with a SSL endpoint, a docker compose file is provided in this repository.
Here are the steps to reproduce:

1. Uncomment the line in the network file in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```docker
    networks:
      searxng:
        ipam:
          driver: default
      nginx-proxy-manager_web-proxy: # If you want to use Nginx Proxy Manager network
        external: true
    ```

2. Start the NPM instance:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -f docker-compose-npm.yml up -d 
    ```

3. Start the SearXNG stack:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

4. Creates the DNS record from your DNS manager with your `DOMAIN`
5. Add the Proxy Host on NPM
  Use the following settings:
     - **Scheme**: `http`
     - **Forward Hostname / IP**: `searxng.dockerlocal`
     - **Port**: `8080`

    Create a new SSL certificates and check:

    - **Force SSL**
    - **HTTP/2 Support**
    - **HSTS enabled**

  Well done you finished the configuration ðŸ¥³  
  Now go on your `DOMAIN` url, you should see the HomePage !

## Reference
